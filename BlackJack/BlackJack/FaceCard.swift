//1. Create a new Swift file called FaceCard, create an enum of the same name that has a jack, queen and king case.
//  Make the raw value a String.

// Make sure your enum conforms to CaseIterable in order for the newDeck() method to work.
enum FaceCard: String, CaseIterable {
    case jack = "ðŸŽƒ"
    case queen = "ðŸ‘¸"
    case king = "ðŸ¤´"
